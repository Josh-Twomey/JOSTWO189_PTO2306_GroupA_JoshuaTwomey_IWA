challenge-1.js

-Changed some const variables to let as they change values later on in the code
-Changed status variable to member as status is a depricated term
-Added another variable year to complete task:
 const date: 2050
 const status: 'student'
 const count = 0

 ->

 let date = 0;
 const year = 2050;
 const member = 'student';
 let count = 0;


-Added == signs in all if-statements so the if-statement compares vs sets the variable to the new value:
(date = 2050) -> (year === 2050)

- Closed bracket for consolelog:
console.log("January", 'New Year’s Day' -> console.log("January", 'New Year’s Day')

-Removed let from all the counts as you cannot reassign a variable:

let count = count + 4 -> count = count + 4

-Added correct variables to consolelog:

console.log('Your status is:', status)
console.log('The year is:', date)
console.log('The total holidays is:', count)

->

console.log("Your status is:", member);
console.log('The year is:', year)
console.log('The total holidays is:', count)
